Title: An easy way to deploy a unifired R environment and training materials for Zamanian Lab members.
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Nic Wheeler
Maintainer: Nic Wheeeler <nicolas.j.wheeler@gmail.com>
Description: This package is very simple. Installation will install the preferred versions of core packages.
    The meat can be found in `inst/tutorials`, which contains a variety of tutorials I have developed to 
    begin teaching R to new lab members who have little to no R experience.
